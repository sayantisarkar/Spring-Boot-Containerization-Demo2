don't give camel cased names in table scripts
if you give then it will turn to snake case and will cause problem in execution
as there will be an impedance mis match between the variable  names and 
column names 
to avoid it there are 2 solutions:
1) give all the column names either in small case or in capital case
2) if first is not followed then use @column annotation to avoid the ambiguity 
and map all the instance variables to the columns  of the table using either capital case or small case
so that Spring Boot should not generate the snake case


following dependencies are added to make it work:
  
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		 <dependency>
            <groupId>mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
        </dependency>
